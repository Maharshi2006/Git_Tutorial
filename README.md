## âœ¨ Core Git Concepts: What They Are & How to Use Them

This section details essential Git commands and concepts.

### 1. `git clone`

* **What it is:** Used to create a local copy of an existing Git repository from a remote source. It downloads all files, branches, and the entire commit history.
* **How to use:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url> [destination_directory]
    ```

### 2. Local Repository / Remote Repository

* **Local Repository:** The copy of the Git repository that resides on your own computer, containing all project files, history, and branches.
* **Remote Repository:** A version of the repository hosted on a server (e.g., GitHub), serving as a central point for collaboration and backup.

### 3. `git pull`

* **What it is:** Used to fetch changes from a remote repository and integrate (merge) them into your current local branch. It combines `git fetch` and `git merge`.
* **How to use:**
    ```bash
    git pull [remote_name] [branch_name]
    ```

### 4. `git push`

* **What it is:** Used to upload your local commits to a remote repository, making your local changes available to others and updating the remote's history.
* **How to use:**
    ```bash
    git push [remote_name] [branch_name]
    ```
    * For the first push of a new local branch: `git push -u origin <branch_name>`

### 5. `git commit`

* **What it is:** Used to record changes to the repository as a snapshot of your project at a specific time.
* **How to use:**
    * First, stage your changes: `git add .` or `git add <file_name>`
    * Then, commit:
        ```bash
        git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
        ```

### 6. `git merge`

* **What it is:** Used to combine changes from one branch into another, integrating the source branch's history into the target branch.
* **How to use:**
    1.  Switch to the target branch:
        ```bash
        git checkout <target_branch>
        ```
    2.  Perform the merge:
        ```bash
        git merge <source_branch>
        ```

### 7. Branch Creation and Branch Merging

* **Branch Creation:**
    * **What it is:** Creating a separate line of development to work on new features or fixes in isolation.
    * **How to use:**
        * Create new branch (stay on current):
            ```bash
            git branch <new_branch_name>
            ```
        * Create and switch to new branch:
            ```bash
            git checkout -b <new_branch_name>
            ```
* **Branch Merging:** (Refer to `git merge` section above)

### 8. `git stash`

* **What it is:** Temporarily saves changes that you don't want to commit immediately, allowing you to switch contexts without losing work.
* **How to use:**
    1.  **Stash changes:**
        ```bash
        git stash [save "Optional message"]
        ```
    2.  **View stashes:**
        ```bash
        git stash list
        ```
    3.  **Apply stashed changes:**
        ```bash
        git stash apply [stash@{n}] # Applies a specific stash, keeps it in list
        git stash pop             # Applies most recent stash, removes it from list
        ```
    4.  **Clear/Drop stashes:**
        ```bash
        git stash clear           # Removes all stashes
        git stash drop [stash@{n}] # Removes a specific stash
        ```

### 9. `git revert`

* **What it is:** Undoes a specific commit by creating a *new commit* that reverses the target commit's changes. It maintains history integrity.
* **How to use:**
    ```bash
    git revert <commit_hash>
    ```

### 10. `git reset`

* **What it is:** A powerful command to undo local changes by moving the `HEAD` pointer to a specified commit, essentially rewriting history *locally*.
* **How to use:**
    ```bash
    git reset [--soft | --mixed | --hard] <target_commit_ish>
    ```
    * `--soft`: Moves `HEAD`, keeps changes staged.
    * `--mixed` (default): Moves `HEAD`, unstages changes.
    * `--hard`: Moves `HEAD`, discards all changes. (Use with caution!)
